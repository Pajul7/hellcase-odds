# hellcase-odds
A shitty python script to calculate how much you're getting fucked by hellcase.

Gives you the expected value of a case, the average "gain" :-)
value and  percentage you make by opening this case.

It requires Chrome installed on you pc and the selenium python library.


/!\ works only on linux, feel free to suggest a working windows version.

To install selenium :

  \> pip install selenium

To install chrome : 

  \> https://www.google.com/chrome/


I made this script on the fly without caring,
so it's unreadable, certainly not optimized, and i'm pretty sure
i commited several programming war crimes,
but i'm too lazy to rewrite it.
Use it as you want.

Best regards,
Pajul
